Let’s start this blog off with the traditional greeting! I’m inspired by the writings of [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net), [Eli Bendersky](https://eli.thegreenplace.net), [Charity Majors](https://charity.wtf) and [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me). I plan to use this blog to document what I read online and in print, and perhaps to share my own thoughts too.
